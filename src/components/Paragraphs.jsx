            <p>
                I'm Marlene, a frontend web developer with a passion for creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites.
                When I'm not coding, you can find me skateboarding around town or hanging out with my cats.
                Don't hesitate to connect with me on LinkedIn and learn more about my work!
            </p>
            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>
                I'm interested in a variety of things, including web development, cats (I have an adorable feline named Matisse), traveling, skateboarding, playing the ukulele, photography, flowers, and cooking.
            </p>
